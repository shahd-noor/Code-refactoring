# Code-refactoring
Define a constant variable whose name" Dimension =500" ..and replace it with the place of the variable(Width:500,hight:500).
Deleting a variable named move (there is no need for it) .. in addition to deleting its comment.
Modify the variable name "ans"to a name"answer" (so that it becomes a meaningful concept, for any programmer who reads the code other than the writer).
Definition of a constant variable whose name"canselValue" denotes the number 1.
Define a constant variable whose name"approveValue" denotes the number 0.
Define a constant variable whose name"yesValue" denotes the number 0.
Define a constant variable whose name"waringValue" denotes the number 2.
 Delete comments indicating numbers.
 
The goal of the Code Refactoring is to speed up the code, make it easy for the reader and external programmer to understand, and to easily modify it
